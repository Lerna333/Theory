A state diagram, sometimes known as a state machine diagram, is a type of behavioral diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that shows transitions between various objects.A state machine is any device that stores the status of an object at a given time and can change status or cause other actions based on the input it receives. States refer to the different combinations of information that an object can hold, not how the object behaves. In order to understand the different states of an object, you might want to visualize all of the possible states and show how an object gets to each state, and you can do so with a UML state diagram.
